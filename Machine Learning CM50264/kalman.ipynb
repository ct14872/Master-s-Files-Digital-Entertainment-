    "Having dug up snuggly beard's skeleton at 3 in the morning and measured her leg bones you place a Gaussian distribution over step size of 0.58 meters, with a standard deviation of 0.04 meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately the Drunken Duck was burnt to the ground during a drunken brawl many years ago, and no evidence of its original location remains. Feeling a bit foolish for the unnecessary exhumation in the dead of night, you purchase a metal detector and, after a few hours, find the treasure. It is exactly 30 meters north of some bee hives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feeling rich, and like you really aught to justify taking a crowbar to that coffin, you decide to rebuild the Drunken Duck. Talking to a local relic, possibly a zombie, he tells you that the pub used to be 7 meters north-west of the bee hives. Given he is crunching through whiskey drenched oats at the time, you put a standard deviation of 5 meters on his evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative to the bee hives, where should you be building? Combine all information and give the parameters of a Gaussian over the 2D offset from the bee hives.\n",
